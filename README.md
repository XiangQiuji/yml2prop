YAML TO JAVA PROPERTIES MAVEN PLUGIN
========

This is a Maven Plugin which helps to generate java *.properties from *.yml (www.yaml.org).

#### Issue of do maintain java *.properties
Building the same artifact for different environments (`staging`, `development`, `production`...) has always been an annoyance. Developer need to do maintainance multiple .properties files (as given tree bellow). Actually, they have a few different values, such as : `connection.url`, `connection.usname`, `connection.pwd`...

Maven Profile plugin is a great tool to help when giving you an ability to do maintain your files, see [Maven Profile guide!](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-building-for-different-environments.html). In short, your files will be in a tree like bellow
```
├── resources
│   ├── dev
│   │   ├── log4j.properties
│   │   └── appplication.properties
│   └── local
│       ├── log4j.properties
│       └── application.properties
```

This is actual annoying if you have so many many environments and many many many properties need your maintenance (like my `sample.properties` - soure code).

#### Example configuration
Define all properties for all environments in a YAML format (*.yml) like bellow
```ruby
dev:
  elasticsearch:
    cluster:
      name: staging-es-w-chef
    host: XXXXXXXX:9300
  scheduled:
    cron: 0/1 * * * * *

prod:
  scheduled:
    cron: 0 0/5 * * * *
```

The given example is to generate `prod` from `dev`.
```xml
<build>
   <plugins>
      <plugin>
         <groupId>com.github.phuonghuynh</groupId>
         <artifactId>yml2prop</artifactId>
         <version>1.0</version>
         <configuration>
            <sourceYaml>${basedir}/src/main/resources/test.yml</sourceYaml>
            <entries>
               <param>dev</param>
               <param>prod</param>
            </entries>
         </configuration>
         <executions>
            <execution>
               <phase>generate-resources</phase>
               <goals>
                  <goal>run</goal>
               </goals>
            </execution>
         </executions>
      </plugin>
   </plugins>
</build>
```

To run this plugin: 
```bash
mvn yml2prop:run
```

And sample result like this (for `prod` environment)
```java
#Generated by Yml2Prop plugin.
#Fri Sep 26 22:02:07 ICT 2014
scheduled.cron=0 0/5 * * * *
elasticsearch.cluster.name=XXXXXXXX:9300
elasticsearch.host=172.16.22.27\:9300
```
#### Configuration parameters:
> `sourceYaml`: String - source path of your yaml file
> `entries`: Array of Strings - array of names that will be used to extracted to *.properties, ex: dev, prod, staging...
> `destProp`: String - destination path of your properties file
